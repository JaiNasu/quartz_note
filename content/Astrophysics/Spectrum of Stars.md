## Introduction

The only "visible" part of the stars are their surfaces, or which we call **atmosphere** of stars.
The light/ radiation that we observe from stars is primarily emitted from their atmospheres.

## Physical Processes

### Radiation and Absorption

An atom is a system consisting of a nucleus and surrounding electrons.
The radiations from an atom are produced by transitions between its energy states.
A **bounded** energy state has a discrete, **quantized** energy level, while a **free** energy state has a continuous energy level(ionized state).
Atomic radiations thus can be classified into three types:

1. **Bound-bound** (line spectrum)

A transition between two energy states $E_i < E_j$ emits a photon of energy $E = E_i - E_j$, or frequency $\nu$:
$$
\nu = \frac{E_j - E_i}{h}
$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant.

2. **Bound-free** (continuum spectrum)

A transition from a bound state $E_i$ to a free state $E_\kappa$ results in emissions of a continuous spectrum:
$$
\nu = \frac{E_\kappa - E_i}{h}
$$
or inversely a transition from a free state $E_\kappa$ to a bound state $E_i$ results in absorption of light:
$$
\nu = \frac{E_\kappa - E_i}{h}
$$

3. **Free-free** (bremsstrahlung)

This is a phenomenon classically explained as **bremsstrahlung**, where the acceleration of charged particles cause radiations.
